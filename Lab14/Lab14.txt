(a) Can latency be eliminated completely? Explain why.

No, latency should be minimized as much as possible, but although data moves around at the speed of light on fiber-optic cables, the distance between the user and the server, and delays on internet infrastructure equipment mean latency can be never eliminated completely.

(b) Use an example (shooting round corners/fire-proof problem, etc.) to illustrate how latency is related to consistency? Use diagrams if appropriate.      

The ghost bullets are one of the latency problems. When a player shoots at a high latency it doesnâ€™t register the hit to the enemy player and the player dies from the server not registering the shot at the beginning.
                  

(c) There are two categories of techniques for consistency management: optimistic and conservative. Which category do the following techniques belong to: dumb client and client-side prediction. Describe the dumb client and client-side prediction.

The dumb client is in the category of conservative. A dumb client depends on a connection to a server for its
functionality. The dumb client sends an input to the server which the server calculates the state and sends it back to the clients.

Client-side prediction is applying each input to the client's own state and sending it to the server. Each input is stored in chronological order in a buffer, along with the state of the player of that time.
Once it has been sent, the server applies each input as they are received and then transmits the state back to the client with the time of that state.
