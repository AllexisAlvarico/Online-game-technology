Question 4:
Version: The first IP header field is a 4-bit version indicator. The value of its four bits is set to 0100.
If the router does not support the specified version, the packet will be dropped.

Helen: Internet header length, short for Helen. This component is used to show how many 32-bit words are present in the header.
Service: Service is also called differentiated service code point or DSCP. this field is provivded feature related to the quality
of service for data streaming or VoIP calls.

Total Length: Total lenght is measured in bytes. The minimum size of an IP datagram is 20 bytes and the maximum, it can be 65535 bytes.
Helen and total length can be used to calculate the dimension of the payload. All hosts are required to be able to read 576-byte datagram.

Identification: Identifying fragments of an IP datagram uniquely.

Flags: Flag is a three-bit field that helps you control and identify fragments. Bit 0 is reserved and has to be set to zero,
bit 1 means do not fragment, and bit 2 means more fragments.

Fragmentation Offset: represents the number of data bytes ahead of the particular fragment in the specific datagram. It is specified
in terms of the number of 8 bytes which has a maximum value of 65528 bytes.
 
Time to live: It is an 8-bit field that indicates the maximum time the datagram will be live in the internet system. The time duration is
measured in seconds, and when the value of TTL is zero, the datagram will be erased.

Protocol: This IPv4 header is reserved to denote that internet protocol is used in the latter portion of the datagram.

Header Checksum: The Ip header us compared to the value of its checksum. When the header checksum is not matching, 
then the packet will be discarded.

Source IP Address: The source address is a 32-bit address of the source used for the IPv4 packet.

Destination IP address: The destination address is also 32 bit in size stores the address of the receiver.

Data: This field stores the data from the protocol layer, which has handed over the data to the IP layer.

Question 5:

The differnce is the protocol, I had TCP and this packet has ICMP. The flags are also differnce where my one no fragments and this one has more fragment
