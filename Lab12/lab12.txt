Lab 12:

A)What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 
client/server and peer to peer multiplayer game architectures?

Advantage:
Client-server:
- Server can control and record
transactions by clients.
- Server can work with a wider
variety of clients.

P2P:
- Popular data = more distribution = faster
- Peers need to be fairly compatible.

Disadvantage:
Client-server:
- Popular data = more congestion = slower
- The efficiency and reliabilty depend on server

P2P:
- Peers need to find each other
- Transactions are not recorded, harder to trace

B) In the peer-to-peer network architecture with authoritative host, 
how the peers communicate with each other? Draw diagrams to aid 
your explanation if appropriate.

- Its the same setup as traditional peer-to-peer but with one host(Authoritative) going around
to other host and giving their IP address when the Authoritative host finds a new ones and passes
the information forwards to another hosts.

(c) In the context of "port restricted" NAT devices, what does the hole-punching technique do? 
Describe this technique, using a diagram to aid your explanation if appropriate. 

Circumventing NAT with UDP hole punching is the technique. Its is called UDP hole punching because
it punches a hole in the firewall of the network which allows a packet from an outside system to
successfully reach the desired client on a network using NAT.
