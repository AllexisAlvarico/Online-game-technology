Q.1
A = 10
B = 1111
C = 1110
D = 110
E = 0


A(2) + B(4) + C(4) + D(3) + E(1) /5

Q.2
Delta compression is usually applied in cases where there is a high degree of redundancy
between target and references files, leading to a much smaller compressed
size than could be achieved by just compressing the target file by itself.

Example to use delta compression, is when revision control systems versioned
file systems that store many version or content updates over networks where
the recipient already has an older version of the data.
